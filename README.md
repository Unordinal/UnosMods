# UnosRoR2Mods
## Mods
### InfoOnPing
Shows information about the pinged object in chat.
### BossTeleportPercent
Charges the teleporter a certain percent when the boss is killed. Configurable.
### DebugCheats
A mod for my personal use in debugging my other plugins - added to when I need it.
### ToolbotEquipmentSwap
Lets people playing as MUL-T swap their equipment with a dedicated key. It also optionally stops MUL-T's Retool ability from swapping his equipment slots. Configurable.
### DropItems
Lets players drop the last pickup they picked up. Key is configurable.
### StartingSpeedBuff
Adds the Warbanner buff to all players until a given stage is reached. Stage number is configurable and buff is removed *when that stage starts.*
### UnosUtilities
Helper library, not a mod. Used mainly by InfoOnPing to give extension functions. Most of these are easily implementable yourself or are already in the RoR2 library (*cough* RoR2Colors *cough*) but it was my first plugin so meh!

## Requirements
All mods require BepInEx and R2API. You can get these at https://thunderstore.io/
