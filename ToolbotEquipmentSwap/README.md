# ToolbotEquipmentSwap
Lets people playing as MUL-T swap their equipment with a dedicated key. It also optionally stops MUL-T's Retool ability from swapping his equipment slots. Configurable.
## Configuration
*Server-side options apply to everyone in the server based on the host's config file setting.*

SwapKey: The key to swap between MUL-T's equipment slots. *(Default: X)*

StopAutoSwap (Server-side): Whether to stop the equipment slot changing when using MUL-T's Retool ability. *(Default: true)*
- If this is true, clients will not be able to swap equipment at all unless they also have the mod installed.
